		I am currently a Junior at Clemson University studying Computer Science. I have a wide range of interests
		and I love learning about everything around me. Some of my hobbies include cycling, football, 
		and working on one of my many half-finished projects.

		I am currently working on a few main projects. I am an undergraduate researcher with the 
		TigerSec lab at Clemson University, where I am improving my embedded systems and C 
		programming abilities by working with very new microcontrollers. I am also working at 
		the CCIT helpdesk, where I assist students and faculty with their technical issues. I 
		have also been focused on applying to jobs lately, and that's been taking up a large
		chunk of my time. Additionally, I have a home server where I self host things, I'm working on 
		getting my Network+ certification, and I am always working on some sort of project 
		involving microcontrollers.
