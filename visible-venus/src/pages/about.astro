	<h3>Who I Am</h3>
		<p>
			I am currently a Junior at Clemson University studying Computer Science. I'm from the Greenville, SC area, where I lived with 
			my sister (pictured with me above) and my parents. Before that I have lived in Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama.
			I have a wide range of interests and I love learning about everything around me. Some of my hobbies include cycling, football, 
			and working on one of my many half-finished projects. 
		</p>

	<h3>Current Coursework</h3>
		<p>
			I am currently taking Intro to Computer Organizations, Linear Algebra, Computing Ethics, Network
			Programming, and Software Engineering. 
		</p>

	<h3>Projects/Involvements</h3>
		<p>
			Apart from school, I am working on a few projects. I am an undergraduate researcher with the 
			TigerSec lab at Clemson University, where I am improving my embedded systems and C 
			programming abilities by working with very new microcontrollers. I am also working at 
			the CCIT helpdesk, where I assist students and faculty with their technical issues. I 
			have also been focused on applying to jobs lately, and that's been taking up a large
			chunk of my time. Additionally, I have a home server where I self host things, I'm working on 
			getting my Network+ certification, and I am always working on some sort of project 
			involving microcontrollers.
