In this post, Iâ€™ll talk about a project I made my freshman year of college with my roommate Life Rouby. It was an e-bike conversion kit that we made for the SPARK program. 

## What is SPARK?
- Year long program that teaches about taking ideas and turning them into viable business ideas
- Pitch prep, idea generation, business viability, assistance in developing your prototype, funding for building a prototype
- Weekly meetings with other SPARK participants and mentors. 
### What is AnyBike?
- Ideas
    - E-bike conversion kit designed to "Turn any bike into an e-bike"
    - Mounted onto the rear part of the bicycle where the seatpost is right next to the rear tire
    - Friction drive motor provided electric assistance. battery is mounted under the top tube. wireless throttle on the handlebars. 
    - Product was inspired by my love for cycling and the on campus e-bikes that Clemson has. The Clemson e-bikes retail for thousands of dollars. I wanted to see if there was a cheaper way to get more People riding their bike by introducing a low cost, easy-to-install, conversion kit for their existing bikes. 
    - Learned about business pitches
    - Didnt do very well in the SPARK competition, got a lot of feedback about how our product/presentation just wasn't very polished. Not a lot of business related info on it
    - We finished the prototype at 2am the morning of the competition, so we honestly didn't really spend a lot of time on the other aspects of it. I am glad I learned that lesson because it is important in the real world to not only have a great product, but explain it in a great way so that everyone can understand. 
    - Went through a lot of iterations and prototypes until we reached a final design for the competition. Wasn't the greatest design, but it was good enough for a demo during the program. 
    - Stopped working on it after the competition, but it was very viable. I have seen a few companies make similar products since then. 
    - Insert pic of Life and I at the competition. 

- Should probably have different headers for things

### What was AnyBike?

### Design Iterations?
- Ideas
    - Maybe try to find old CAD history
    - Tearing apart lifes old electric scooter to try and take parts from it
    - Ended up going with electric skateboard parts
    - Exploring different ways to actually deliver the power, different places to mount the motor, different power options, etc 
### Timeline
- maybe we can combine this with design iterations
### Business Aspect
- Talk about the market research Life did
- Some of the nitty gritty of the pitch we gave
- How we really didn't spend a ton of time on it
### What did I learn?
- Kind of the same answer as the what would I have done differently. 
- I want to talk about the joy of being able to spend a lot of time working on a project you are passionate about. How its awesome that SPARK gives funding for it as well. That would honestly be the dream. Have an organization fund me to work on my various ideas. 
### What would I have done differently?
- I would have spent more time on the business aspect of it. A lot of my time went into creating a half-decent prototype, but it didn't really yield me many results. The most successful people at the SPARK competition were the people that had a firm idea of what their product would do in the future, and had a very thorough, well-spoken, and visually appealing presentation to go along with it. The people you are presenting to don't care about the technical aspects of your presentation. They want to see if your product is a viable business, and they can only do that if you make your vision crystal clear to them. I had a clear vision in my head, but it wasn't protrayed well to the judges. One of the pieces of feedback we recieved was about how our prototype just didn't look very good. That's part of the reason I am doing SPARK again in my junior year, I want to be able to develop the other set of skills.
