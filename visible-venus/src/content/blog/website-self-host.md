## Why Self-Host?
I chose to self-host my website because I already had a home server. I've been self-hosting some applications since the start of 2025, so I had a pretty solid setup to work with. Something that I didn't have any experience with was hosting something that was publicly accessible. I currently access my services by connecting to a vpn, but I can't have all potential user's of my website do that. I really wanted to learn how to set that up. I also like the control of self-hosting. I have full control over pretty much everything. I can easily switch to a non-static website that makes API calls to retrive content at any time. A lot of cloud providers don't make that process easy. I am also not expecting to have a lot of users on this site, so I don't really need the horsepower of a cloud provider.
