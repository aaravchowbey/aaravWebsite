Writing my first update here. I need to go over what SPARK is at some point before this. I will just assume that SPARK is explained. I am going to explain what my idea is and what I have done on it so far. Maybe I will go back and update it with actual timestamps at some point. 

My idea is called REACT. Reusable Emergency Activated Camera Technology. It is meant to be used in areas where cameras are either hard to setup (music festival on a field, event in the middle of a city, etc) or by law enforcement, colleges, etc. Imagine a kid gets lost. The only thing you can really do is go and tell the local officer/security personnel. It is hard for them to get a picture of the child out, communicate with every other security person, and cover a lot of ground at the same time. My solution to this is a reusable, easy to deploy, emergency activated, set of cameras. Imagine a box with a camera on the front and solar panels on top. This box can be placed in an area that is not watched by people. Now imagine a network of these boxes, all placed around the perimeter of an area. They are all able to talk to each other and easily pinpoint the location of a missing child. In an emergency situation now, you go up to an officer, provide them an image of your child, and they are able to upload it to REACT and bring the cameras online. The response time is instant. 

So far I have fleshed out the idea a good bit, but I have not fully designed a prototype yet. I am working on a parts list and a full CAD. I have an idea of what I want my dmeo to look like. There would be two of the boxes, one that is just a camera and one that is a camera and a drone. I push a button, a screen shows the camera feeds, and the drone comes out of the box and hovers for a bit. Still need to come up with a parts list that is within budget though. That might not be a doable task. 

I have also started on a rough version of my business pitch. It is not polished yet, but its starting to take shape very well. I need to make an actual rendering of the product in action. Maybe I can mock up the software side of it as well. I also struggle to effectively communicate the elevator pitch. Its a really hard concept for me to explain well. My business model would either be a rental based approach or a tiered software based approach after you buy the hardware. So first you would buy the actual modules, then you would get charged per activation depending on what kind of software you want to subscribe to. I like the rental idea a lot more though, where it's just a person who comes and sets it up and monitors it for the duration of your event. 

So far I have an idea, a problem, a target audience, a business model, and the start of a slide deck. I need to create a parts list, a CAD of a prototype, a prototype, a pitch, and a polished slide deck.
